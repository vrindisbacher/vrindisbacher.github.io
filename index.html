        <p class="section-text">
          Hello! I am a Software Engineer based in Austin, Texas and a recent graduate of Boston University's Computer
          Science program.
          Before entering the world of Computer Science, I spent most of my time racing bicycles,
          achieving podiums at
          National Championships and competing the Canadian National Team. I wrote code for the first time during my
          Sophomore year of college,
          but my passion for Computer Science was first ignited by an Introduction to Programming Languages class.
          This led me to aggressively pursue a curriculum of graduate courses, including a class on Formal Methods.
        </p>
        <p class="section-text">
          Next year, I hope to begin my PhD in the area of programming languages.
          Currently, I am conducting research on <i>Formally Verifying Algorithms for Differential Privacy</i>, with
          <a href="https://cs-people.bu.edu/gaboardi/" target="_blank">Professor Marco Gaboardi (BU)</a> and
          <a href="http://arthuraa.net/" target="_blank">Professor Arthur Azevedo De Amorim (RIT)</a>. My research
          interests mainly lie in Formal Verification,
          along with a keen interest in Type Theory and other light weight formal methods. I am particularly interested in verifying
	  real programs (in existing languages) using Hoare and Separation Logic. Ultimately, I would like my work to directly impact 
	  the number of terrifying function and logic bugs that exist in code.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-heading">Research Interests</h2>
        <p class="section-text">
          Writing correct code can be a difficult task. Initially, I believed that Formal Methods could be the solution
          to ensuring all software is correct.
          However, the overhead of performing mechanized mathematical proofs can be too high to achieve such an
          ambitious goal.
          As a result, I am deeply interested in finding ways to lower the barriers for engineers to ensure that
          productionalized code is correct.
        </p>
        <p class="section-text">
          In my future research, I aim to work at the intersection of theory and engineering.
          I strongly believe that great engineering is propelled by theory, but for systems to be effective, the theory
          must be abstracted away.
          Thus, my focus is on research that can have an immediate impact on industrial applications.
          My work on Differential Privacy is an example of this.

	      This extended abstract details part of my work on verifying algorithms for
              Differential Privacy using the Coq Proof Assistant. I submitted and presented this work at CoqPL
              2023. Since then, I have verified two "fast" implementations of the Geometric Mechanism, and am working 
	      on verifying a few other DP Mechanisms using a library derived from my original work.
