        <p class="section-text">
          Hi there! I am a recent graduate of Boston University's Computer Science program, 
          and currently a Software Engineer based out of Austin, Texas. Next year, I hope to begin 
          my PhD in the area of Programming Languages. 
        </p>
        <p class="section-text">
          I spent most of my time in high school racing bicycles at a high level. My palmares include
          podiums at National Championships and membership of the Canadian National Team. In 2018, I began my Bachelor's 
          degree in Health Science, but switched to Computer Science and wrote code for the first time
          after a Freshman Internship at CCNS, a high performance coaching and testing company. I took my first <i>Introduction to
          Programming Languages</i> class and fell in love with the topic. This led me to aggressively pursue a curriculum of 
          graduate courses, the most notable being a class on Formal Methods. 
        </p>
        <p class="section-text">
          Currently, I am conducting Research on <i>Formally Verifying Algorithms for Differential Privacy</i>, with 
          <a href="https://cs-people.bu.edu/gaboardi/" target="_blank">Professor Marco Gaboardi</a> and 
          <a href="http://arthuraa.net/" target="_blank">Professor Arthur Azevedo De Amorim</a>. My research interests 
          are mainly in the area of Formal Verification, but I am also interested in type theory, language semantics, 
          and probabilistic programming. My goal is to work in the cross section of engineering and theory.

        <h2 class="section-heading">Research Interests</h2>
        <p class="section-text">
          Writing correct code is hard. When I first learned about Formal Methods I believed that all software should be verified. 
          Unfortunately, the overhead of doing mechanized mathematical proofs is too large to realistically be able to accomplish such 
          an expansive goal. Thus, I have a keen interest on lowering the barriers for engineers to ensure that productionalized code  
          is correct. 
        </p>
        <p class="section-text">
          In my future research, I aim to work in the cross section of theory and engineering. I believe that great engineering is driven 
          by theory, but for systems to be useful, the theory must be abstracted away. Thus, I am heavily focused on work that can have 
          immediate impact on industrial applications. My work on Differential Privacy is an example of this.
